# Geolocating Images using Bing

This project focuses on building a script that utilizes Bing's reverse search feature to gather GPS information for given images. The main goal is to geolocate images by extracting their geographical coordinates.

## Project Overview

The Bing Scraper project is designed to provide an efficient solution for extracting GPS information from images. The script employs an asynchronous approach, similar to multithreading, to ensure faster computation using the asyncio library.

## Key Features

- Reverse Search: The script performs a reverse search using Bing's API to extract GPS information for given images.
- Asynchronous Computation: The implementation of asynchronous programming allows for efficient and concurrent image processing.
- Data Collection: The script collects geolocation data for images and extracts their GPS coordinates.
- Bing API Integration: Utilizing Bing's reverse search feature, the script interacts with the Bing API to retrieve relevant GPS information.

## Usage

1. Clone the project repository from [here](link-to-repository).
2. Install the required dependencies using the package manager of your choice (e.g., pip).
3. Obtain Bing API credentials by creating an account on the Bing Developers portal.
4. Update the script with your Bing API credentials.
5. Run main.py, providing the image(s) for which you want to gather GPS information in the images-input/ directory.
